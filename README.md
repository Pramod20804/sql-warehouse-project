# 🚀 Welcome to the Modern Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to my Data Warehouse project! This repository showcases a practical implementation of a modern data architecture using the **Bronze-Silver-Gold layered approach**, followed by **ETL, data modeling, and analytics**. This project is designed to demonstrate real-world data engineering concepts in a clean and scalable manner.

## 📦 About the Project

This project simulates a complete data engineering workflow starting from raw data ingestion to delivering analytics-ready datasets for business intelligence.

### 🧱 Architecture: Bronze-Silver-Gold Layers

- **🥉 Bronze Layer** – Stores raw, unprocessed data exactly as received from the source. It serves as the landing zone.
- **🥈 Silver Layer** – Contains cleaned and transformed data. Basic ETL operations like filtering, joins, and type casting are performed here.
- **🥇 Gold Layer** – Provides aggregated, business-ready data optimized for reporting and analytics.

### 🔄 ETL Process

- **Extract**: Load data from various sources such as CSV files or APIs.
- **Transform**: Clean, join, and enrich the data in the Silver layer.
- **Load**: Store the final, analytics-ready data in the Gold layer.

### 📊 Analytics

The final Gold-layer data is used to generate insights such as:
- Business performance metrics
- Trend analysis
- Aggregated reports for stakeholders
